### Overview

The Bus Servo Driver Board is a compact and powerful hardware solution from Seeed Studio, designed to drive serial bus servos for robotics and automation projects. With support for UART communication, it enables precise control and feedback from multiple ST/SC series servos, making it ideal for applications such as robotic arms, hexapods, humanoid robots, and wheeled robots requiring servo angle and load feedback.

This guide focuses on the hardware setup, physical connections, key specifications, and **critical jumper settings** to help users integrate the board into their projects effectively.

:::warning Safety Warning

Always disconnect power before connecting or disconnecting servos or wiring. Ensure the input voltage matches the servo requirements to avoid damage.

:::

### Physical Layout and Connections

The Bus Servo Driver Board features several key connection points:

**Input:**

* **DC IN (5.5 * 2.1mm):** This is the power input for the board and the connected servos. Connect a 5~12V power supply here. *Crucially, the voltage of this power supply must match the voltage requirements of your servos.* For example, ST series servos typically operate at 9V, while SC series servos may require 12V.

**Output:**

* **Servo Interface:** This dedicated port is where you connect your ST/SC series bus servos. Ensure the connector is properly aligned.

**Control Interface:**

* **UART (RX/TX):** These pins provide serial communication for controlling the servos. The connection method and jumper settings depend on your host device. See below for details.

### Connection Methods and Jumper Settings

The Bus Servo Driver Board offers two primary connection methods: direct UART connection and USB connection via a USB-to-UART adapter. *The correct jumper setting is essential for proper operation.*

**1. Direct UART Connection (for MCUs, XIAO, ESP32, etc.)**

This method is used when connecting directly to the UART pins of a microcontroller (MCU) like an ESP32, Arduino, Seeed Studio XIAO, or a single-board computer.

* **Wiring:**
    * Connect the `RX` pin on the Driver Board to the `TX` pin (D7) on your host device.
    * Connect the `TX` pin on the Driver Board to the `RX` pin (D6) on your host device.
    * For devices like the Seeed Studio XIAO, you can directly plug the XIAO into the provided headers, ensuring correct pin alignment. This eliminates the need for separate Dupont wires for the UART connection.

* **Jumper Setting (Critical):** Locate the solder jumper near the UART pins. **For direct UART communication, you must ensure that the two pads are connected (soldered together).**

* **Powering the Host:** Your host device (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero, ESP32, XIAO) will require its own separate power supply.

**2. USB Connection**

This method is used when connecting to a computer or single-board computer with a USB port (e.g., a PC or Raspberry Pi 4B). You simply connect the control board to the computer using a USB cable.

* **Wiring:**
    * Simply connect the control board to your computer using a USB cable.

* **Jumper Setting (Critical):** 

**Step1:** Locate the soldering jumper on the back of the board. **For USB communication, you must ensure that the two pads are connected (there is a solder bridge between them).**

### Required Components (Before You Start)

Before connecting anything, ensure you have the following:

* **Bus Servo Driver Board**
* **Compatible ST/SC series bus servos**
* **5~12V Power Supply:** A battery or power adapter. *The voltage must match your servo's specifications.*
* **Host Device:**
    * **For Direct UART:** A UART-capable device like a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, or Seeed Studio XIAO.
    * **For USB:** A computer (PC, Mac, Linux) or a single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi 4B, *plus* a USB-to-UART adapter.
* **Connecting Wires/Adapters:** Jumper wires (Dupont wires) if using direct UART (except when using XIAO with direct header connection). A USB-to-UART adapter if using the USB connection method.

:::caution

If using SC series servos, confirm the power supply matches their voltage requirements. The board’s DC input label is tailored for ST series servos but supports SC series voltages as well. **Incorrect jumper settings will prevent communication with the driver board.**

:::

### Safety and Maintenance

- Regularly check servo and power connections for wear or loose contacts.
- Avoid exposing the board to moisture or extreme temperatures.
- Use a power supply with sufficient current capacity to support all connected servos.

### FAQs

:::tip

It's recommended to read through these FAQs before starting your project. They address common questions and potential issues.

:::

<details> <summary>What if the power supply voltage doesn’t match my servo?</summary>

The board and servo may malfunction or sustain damage. Always match the input voltage to your servo’s requirements.
</details> <details> <summary>Can I connect multiple servos at once?</summary>

Yes, multiple servos are supported, but ensure your power supply can handle the combined current draw.
